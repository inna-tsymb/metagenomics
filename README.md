# Metagenomics Coursework

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of homework assignments and laboratory works completed during the **Metagenomics** course. It documents the end-to-end bioinformatics pipeline for analyzing microbial communities, from raw sequence processing to functional interpretation.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The project is organized by the logical flow of a metagenomic study:

* **`lecture_01/`** – Analysis of Human Gut Microbiome Community Structure.

* **`lecture_02/`** – Analysis of Wastewater Microbiome Data from the Metalog Database.

* **`lecture_03/`** - MWAS -Microbiome Wide Association Study.

* **`lecture_04/`** - Meta-analysis and summary report.

## Bioinformatics Stack

The following tools and languages were utilized:

| Category | Tools Used |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Languages** | Bash/Shell, Python, R |


## Usage

To explore the analysis:
1. Navigate to the specific homework directory.
2. Review the `.sh` or `.ipynb` scripts for the command-line parameters used.
3. Check the `outputs/` subdirectories for visual outputs (e.g., HTML reports or PNG plots).
