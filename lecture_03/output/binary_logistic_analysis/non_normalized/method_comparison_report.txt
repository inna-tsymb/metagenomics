COMPREHENSIVE METHOD COMPARISON: LINEAR vs LOGISTIC REGRESSION
================================================================================

OVERVIEW:
This analysis compares two complementary approaches for identifying species-group
associations in microbiome data:
- Linear regression: Tests for abundance changes (CLR-transformed)
- Logistic regression: Tests for presence/absence patterns (binary)

KEY FINDINGS:

1. OVERALL CONCORDANCE:
   - Both methods significant: 551 species (97.0%)
   - Linear only: 6 species (1.1%)
   - Logistic only: 9 species (1.6%)
   
   ➜ Interpretation: Methods are highly concordant, suggesting robust associations.

2. STRENGTH-OF-EVIDENCE CORRELATION:
   - P-value correlation: r = 0.0488 (weak)
   - Effect size correlation: r = 0.2353 (weak)
   
   ➜ Interpretation: Methods measure different aspects - abundance vs presence. Weak
      correlation expected because they quantify different phenomena.

3. PREVALENCE INSIGHTS (Binary Analysis):
   - Mean prevalence: 72.2% (high colonization)
   - Range: 63.6% - 95.7%
   - No true "sparse" species (< 10% prevalence)
   
   ➜ Interpretation: Species are well-colonized across samples. Binary models may not
      capture as much variation as abundance-based models for this dataset.

4. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN METHODS:

   WHY LINEAR REGRESSION IS SUPERIOR HERE:
   ✓ Species show HIGH prevalence (72% mean) → presence/absence less informative
   ✓ Abundance varies SUBSTANTIALLY between groups → CLR transform captures this
   ✓ No sparse/rare taxa → binary approach loses quantitative information
   ✓ Better statistical power with continuous abundance data
   ✓ Accounts for compositional structure of microbiome data
   
   WHY LOGISTIC REGRESSION COULD BE USEFUL:
   ✓ For datasets with many rare/sparse species
   ✓ When presence/absence threshold is biologically meaningful
   ✓ For clinical diagnostics (e.g., "is species present or not?")
   ✓ Reduces impact of abundance outliers
   ✓ Simpler interpretation in non-technical audiences

5. SPECIES-SPECIFIC PATTERNS:

   Pattern A: Linear ✓, Logistic ✓ (Abundance + Presence effects)
   - Most common (551 species)
   - Species shows both abundance shift AND presence pattern
   - Example interpretation: Species is enriched AND more prevalent in group
   
   Pattern B: Linear ✓, Logistic ✗ (Abundance only)
   - Rare (6 species)
   - Species shifts in abundance but maintains similar presence
   - Example: Species present in 60-80% of all groups, but abundant only in one
   
   Pattern C: Linear ✗, Logistic ✓ (Presence only)
   - Rare (9 species)
   - Species shows presence pattern but similar mean abundance
   - Example: Species present 100% vs 50% but similar abundance when present

================================================================================

RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR YOUR DATA:

1. PRIMARY ANALYSIS: Linear regression (CLR-transformed)
   - More powerful statistically
   - Better suited to well-colonized species
   - Accounts for compositional structure
   - ✓ Already reliable and robust (FDR-significant: 557 species)

2. SECONDARY CONFIRMATION: Logistic regression (binary)  
   - Validates top findings using different methodology
   - Provides presence/absence interpretation
   - ✓ Confirms most associations (98.8% concordant)

3. CLINICAL/COMMUNICATION USE:
   - For presentations: Use "This species is enriched in [GROUP X]" statement
   - For clinicians: Add prevalence information ("present in X% of samples")
   - Combine both types of evidence for maximum impact

================================================================================

STATISTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. PRIMARY ANALYSIS: Report linear regression results
   - Use effect sizes in CLR units
   - Report FDR-corrected p-values
   - Include model R² values

2. SUPPLEMENT WITH: Logistic regression
   - Use effect sizes as prevalence differences
   - Confirms robustness of findings
   - Adds presence/absence interpretation

3. MULTIPLE TESTING: FDR correction
   - Applied to both methods independently
   - Maintains Type-I error control
   - Conservative threshold (α = 0.05)

================================================================================

WHEN WOULD LOGISTIC REGRESSION BE BETTER?

Logistic regression would be SUPERIOR if your data had:
✓ Many species with prevalence < 20% (your data: 0%)
✓ Extreme abundance variation (CLR range too large)  
✓ Need for binary diagnostic interpretation
✓ Zero-inflated distribution patterns
✓ Required presence/absence classification

Your data characteristics:
✗ High prevalence (72% mean) → Unsuitable for logistic
✓ Good abundance variation → Suitable for linear
✗ No sparse taxa → Logistic not needed
✓ Well-distributed data → Linear preferred

CONCLUSION: For your wastewater dataset, LINEAR REGRESSION is the recommended
          primary approach. Logistic regression serves as a useful validation tool.
