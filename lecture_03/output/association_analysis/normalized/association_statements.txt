ASSOCIATION STATEMENTS: Species-Group Relationships
================================================================================

Analysis of top 30 species most strongly associated with wastewater source.

Interpretation Guide:
- POSITIVE association: Species is significantly enriched in a particular wastewater source
- NEGATIVE association: Species is significantly depleted in a particular wastewater source
- Beta (effect size): CLR-space units of abundance difference from global mean
  • Beta > 0 indicates enrichment
  • Beta < 0 indicates depletion
  • Magnitude indicates strength of deviation
